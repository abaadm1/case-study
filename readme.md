**Case Study**


This repository contains the code and data for the High-End Products Venture case study. The case study aims to analyze transaction details, identify user segments, and deploy machine learning models for user targeting and acquisition.

**Introduction**


In this case study, we explore the potential of extending our operations as a vendor of high-end products. The analysis includes understanding user behaviors, identifying user segments, and utilizing machine learning models to target and acquire customers effectively.

**Data**

The data directory contains the sample dataset for transaction details provided for the case study. The dataset includes information about users, transactions, regions, and acquisition details.

**Case Study Tasks**

The case study is divided into two parts:

**Q1 - Data Analyst Tasks**

Identify User based on Purchase Habits and Spending Ability.
Region-Based Analysis of Transactions and Users.
Analysis to help navigate the direction of the new business.


**Q2 - Data Scientist Tasks**

Identify the types of Users who will be a perfect target for the new company.
Identify the susceptible conditions to target and acquire the user.
A Predictor which helps tag newly acquired users according to Location, Time, Purchase Amount, Acquired By, and Acquisition Time.


**Getting Started**


To get started with the case study, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/abaadm1/case-study.git

Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Explore the Jupyter notebooks for Q1 and Q2 in the notebooks directory to see the analysis and implementation.

**Streamlit Application**

The Streamlit application for tagging newly acquired users can be accessed through this link: https://case-study-ksvzg5ealagjnbzh9bgmvy-s.streamlit.app/

The deployed application allows authorized users to input customer information and obtain tags (low-value or high-value) based on the trained machine learning model.
